Here is a rewritten version that sounds like it was written by a 6th grader, using simpler words, shorter sentences, and a more casual tone:

Verlight Project (C++) – About This Project

This is a small C++ project I made to learn how programming languages work. It is an experiment and mostly for learning. I am a student in middle school, and I am still new to programming, so the code is not perfect.

This project is not made for real-world or professional use. It is just for practice and learning.

1. About the Code

The code has some problems, and that is expected, because:

I have only been learning programming for about five months.

I am trying to learn many computer science topics at the same time.

School work and homework limit how much time I can spend improving the project.

Because of this, the code might not be very clean, fast, or well designed. This project should be seen as a learning project, not a finished or professional program.

2. Why I Posted This on GitHub

I uploaded this project to GitHub to:

Learn how to use Git and GitHub.

Practice organizing a C++ project.

Share my work with other beginners who are also learning and making mistakes.

Posting this project does not mean it follows professional coding rules.

3. Feedback and Expectations

If you look at this project, please keep these things in mind:

Please don’t judge it too harshly based on performance or code style.

Some advanced C++ features were not used on purpose because I haven’t learned them yet.

I know the code has limits, and I am still learning.

Helpful and kind feedback is welcome. If you give suggestions, please explain them so I can learn from them.

Notes

The code was not copied from AI tools or websites.

AI was only used to help understand ideas, not to write the code.

Header files were used in a way that made things easier for me to manage in this project.

Good advice and respectful comments are appreciated. Mean or rude comments will be ignored.

About Comments in the Code

Not all files have comments. Some parts are explained, but I didn’t have enough time to comment everything.

Updates:

UPDATE – 14/12/25:
I added comments to the whole codebase to help readers understand how it works.

UPDATE – 15/12/25:
I removed all the comments because people said they looked like they were written by AI.
I worked on this project for 15 days, and it feels really bad to delete all that work 😞.

UPDATE - 16/12/25:
I rewrote the whole README , because of everyone's criticism. Also note : Nowadays , 5th graders write this type
of words.
