Verlight Project (C++) Overview

This repository contains an experimental C++ project developed with the objective of exploring the design and implementation of a simple programming language. The project was created primarily as a learning exercise and should be regarded as such. The author is currently a seventh-grade student, and the codebase reflects an early stage of programming experience.

This project is not intended for professional use, nor should it be evaluated against production-level software standards.

1.Limitations of the Codebase:

The quality and structure of the code are influenced by several factors:

The author is at an early stage of learning computer programming and has been studying programming for approximately six months.

Simultaneously attempting to understand multiple areas of computer science has introduced additional complexity.

Academic obligations and time constraints have further limited opportunities for refinement and optimization.

As a result, the code may lack optimal design patterns, efficiency, and best practices. This repository should therefore be viewed strictly as a personal learning project rather than a polished or production-ready system.

2.Purpose of Publication:

The project has been uploaded to GitHub for the following reasons:

To gain practical experience with version control systems and the GitHub platform.

To practice organizing and publishing a C++ project.

To share a personal learning project with peers who are also in the early stages of programming and may be working with similarly unrefined codebases.

The publication of this repository does not imply that the project meets professional or industry standards.

3.Expectations and Scope of Feedback:

Readers and reviewers are kindly requested to consider the following:

Please refrain from criticizing the codebase purely on performance, architectural decisions, or stylistic choices.

Certain modern C++ features and practices were intentionally not used (e.g., templates, std::visit, or strict separation of source and header files), either due to learning constraints or to simplify development within the chosen environment (Visual Studio Code).

The author acknowledges existing limitations in skill level and does not claim parity with mature or well-established codebases.

Constructive feedback, suggestions, and improvements are welcome, provided they are respectful and, where possible, accompanied by explanations or example solutions.

Notes:

The code was not created through direct copy-and-paste from large language models (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, DeepSeek, Grok, LLaMA) or online forums such as Stack Overflow.

AI tools were used strictly as learning aids to understand concepts, not as sources for direct code reproduction.

Class organization was managed using header files in a manner that simplified control over compilation and virtual machine behavior for this project.

Thoughtful opinions, suggestions, and constructive criticism are appreciated. Toxic or disrespectful commentary will not be considered.

The codebase is not fully commented. While some components (such as MemoryModel.h and the virtual machine implementation) contain explanatory comments, time constraints prevented comprehensive documentation across all files.

Thank you for taking the time to review this project and for approaching it with understanding and professionalism.

[UPDATE]: (14/12/25) The whole codebase has been commented. Commnents will help reader to guide through the code and logic implementation.
[UPDATE]: (15/12/25) I deleted all the comments of the whole codebase . Everyone is crritisizing it because the comments seems being generated by AI's. 
                     15 days of work is gone :( .
